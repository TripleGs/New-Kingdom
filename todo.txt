- make a more sophisticated sound set up and creation.
- Go through and clean other things to make sounds, fonts, more module
- Add a space station
- Come up with a world generation w/ "biomes"
- Create fuel amount, chunks?

Phase 1 (Core Game Mechanics):
- The player should spawn at the space station
- The player should have a fuel bar that goes down the more it goes
- The player score should be replaced with money
- The player money should not increase unless they deploy an arm to grab the asteriod chunks
- When the player goes to the space station they have the option to sell and to purchase fuel
- At the space station the player should be able to purchase upgrades (capacity, bullets, fuel tank)
- Recovery ship that gets the player when they run out of fuel that cost money.

Phase 2 (World Exploration):
- Should have chunk generation that would be restricted in exploration by not having a large enough fuel tank
